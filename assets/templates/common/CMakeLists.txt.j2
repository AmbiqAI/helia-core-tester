# CMakeLists.txt for {{ name }} test
# Auto-generated - do not edit manually
# Generated for operator: {{ operator }}

# This CMakeLists.txt defines the sources and configuration for the {{ name }} test.
# It can be used for:
# - Standalone builds of this test
# - IDE integration
# - Reference for test structure

# Test metadata
set(TEST_NAME {{ name }})
set(TEST_OPERATOR {{ operator }})

# Source files
set(TEST_SOURCES
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/{{ name }}_{{ operator_name }}.c
)

# Include directories
set(TEST_INCLUDE_DIRS
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/includes
)

# Note: The main project CMakeLists.txt will discover test_runner.c files
# and use the sources from this directory when building tests.
# For standalone builds, you would need to:
# 1. Set up CMSIS-NN paths and dependencies
# 2. Create an executable target
# 3. Link against cmsis-nn library
